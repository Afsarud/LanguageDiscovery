    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

				&lt;p&gt;Did you know Japan is called Nihon in Japanese? Let's learn more about Japan and make more friends!
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;1. About Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Japan is a small island country in East Asia located about 5,500 Km north of 
					Australia. Japan in Japanese is "Nihon" which means "the origin of the Sun".&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;img id="imgMap" src="../images/map_jp.jpg" alt="" border="0" width="480" style="FLOAT:left"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Japan consists of four main islands and over 3,000 small islands. The gross area 
					is 377,835 Km2, which is one-twentieth of the area of Australia. However, it 
					has the world's tenth population, about 128 million, which is more than 6 times 
					of the Australian population. Japan is one of the most densely populated 
					countries in the world.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The capital city of Japan is Tokyo. Tokyo is recognised as one of the world 
					biggest cities with 13 million people.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Most of the land of Japan is very mountainous and volcanic which causes many 
					earthquakes. More than 6,000 earthquakes occur in Japan in a year.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					There are 47 prefectures in Japan. Each of them has their own characteristics. 
					You can learn it by enjoying the Game about Japan on the left.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;2. Four seasons&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					In Japan, each of four seasons is very unique and has its own qualities to be 
					enjoyed. Seasons gradually shift from one to another and people enjoy the 
					change.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;img src="../images/sakura1.gif" style="FLOAT:right"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spring&lt;/b&gt;: It is said that spring is the most beautiful season in Japan. The 
					climate is very warm and mild and many flowers bloom such as cherry blossoms. 
					It's a Japanese tradition to have parties with food at parks to enjoy these 
					flowers. (it's called "O-hanami").
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summer&lt;/b&gt;: Averagely, Japanese summer is very hot and humid. People go to 
					the swimming pool or the beach to bear the heat. The outstanding event in 
					summer is fireworks exhibitions. Big fireworks exhibitions are held almost 
					every week during summer. Some of them have more than 12,000 fireworks and last 
					over two hours and 700,000 people go there to enjoy it. It's also a joyful 
					tradition to wear Yukata (casual Japanese traditional dress) at the 
					exhibitions. Watching fireworks while wearing Yukata is fantastic!
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;img src="../images/wintersummer.png" style="FLOAT:left"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autumn&lt;/b&gt;: In autumn, Japanese has a traditional festival known as 
					"おつきみ(O-Tsukimi)".In English, this is often referred to as "Moon Festival" or 
					"Mid-Autumn Festival". During the festival, people see and enjoy the beautiful 
					moon and celebrate the abundance of that year. Japanese people build a special 
					altar outside and eat special food such as "おつきみだんご(O-tsukimi Dango, Dumplings 
					especially made for O-tsukimi).
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winter&lt;/b&gt;: Japan is famous for its snow mountains as well. Not only Japanese 
					but also foreigners including many Australians visit the northern part of Japan 
					to enjoy snow sports. It's also great to enjoy "Onsen(hot spa)" to heat 
					yourselves up and relax after snow.
				&lt;/p&gt;
